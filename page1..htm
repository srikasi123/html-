    <p><h2><i>->The solar system is made up of the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects.
        The solar system is located in the Orion Spur of the Milky Way galaxy, which is a barred spiral galaxy that's about 100,000 light years across.
        The solar system orbits the center of the galaxy about once every 225 million years. The Sun contains about 99.9 percent of all the mass of the solar system.
        The planets' orbits are nearly circular, and range from one-third to 30 times the size of Earth's orbit.<br>->The solar system consists of the sun, the eight planets and the satellites.

            <i><h2>->The Solar System is a vast and intricate celestial structure comprising eight planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other smaller bodies orbiting around the Sun. At its center lies the Sun, a massive star accounting for 99.8% of the Solar System's mass. The four inner planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars - are rocky and relatively small, with Earth being the only known habitable planet.<br>
